# Hi, I’m Naman 👋  
**AI / ML Research Engineer | Curious about breaking models**

I work at the intersection of **machine learning, research, and systems**.  
My primary interest is understanding *why models work, when they fail, and how to make them more reliable* , not just training them to get a number.

I enjoy:
- Building **ML systems grounded in theory**
- Exploring **physics-informed ML, kernels, optimization, and LLM internals**
- Writing code that is **readable, reproducible, and explainable**

---

## 🧠 Current Focus
- NLP, Kernel methods, optimization, and representation learning  
- Large Language Models (training, inference, KV cache, evaluation)  
- Research-grade experiments & ablations (not just demos)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript  
**ML / DS:** PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn  
**Systems & Tools:** Linux, Git, Docker (learning deeper systems internals)  
**Research:** Experiment design, ablation studies, paper reproduction

## 📈 What I Care About
- Understanding **failure modes** of ML models  
- Avoiding “black-box worship”  
- Bridging theory ↔ implementation  
- Long-term: contributing to **research-driven ML teams**

---

## 🤝 Open to
- Data Science Roles
- Research internships (AI / ML / Applied Research)  
- Open-source collaboration  
- Technical discussions & paper reading groups
